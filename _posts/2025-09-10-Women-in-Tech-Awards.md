title: Women in Tech Awards
date: 2025-09-10

This Monday, I had the pleasure to attend my first Women in Tech Awards, for my nomination and making it to the finals for the Apprentice Award!
Though I didn't win, I was up against some very accomplished fellow apprentices; I'm still delighted to have made it to the finals, and I met so many incredible achievers at the event - bright women with incredible ideas.
