Hi, I’m Phoebe - A PwC tech degree apprentice, avid supported of Women in Tech, and part of the internal team of CyberWomen Groups C.I.C.

I love cyber conferences, especially speaking at them - so my new blog is for me to research and share about topics that interest me, in between those conferences!
